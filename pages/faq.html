      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h2>Are these graded?</h2>
      <p>v0 products are <b>raw BU</b>. We do not guarantee a numeric grade unless explicitly stated.</p>

      <h2>What does BU mean here?</h2>
      <p>Brilliant Uncirculated appearance. Raw coins may show typical bag/contact marks and natural toning variation.</p>

      <h2>What does “Our Choice” mean?</h2>
      <p>You receive a BU coin selected from our BU inventory. Dates/mints vary.</p>

      <h2>How do you price coins?</h2>
      <p><b>Spot × 0.77344 oz + premium</b>. Premium drops at higher quantities.</p>

      <h2>Can I request specific dates/mints?</h2>
      <p>Yes — we can quote specific dates/mints separately (availability varies).</p>

      <h2>Payment methods?</h2>
      <p>v0 is designed around low-dispute payment methods (typically wire/ACH). Details are confirmed during order review.</p>

      <h2>How fast do orders ship?</h2>
      <p>We ship after payment clears. You’ll receive tracking once shipped.</p>

      <h2>Do you insure shipments?</h2>
      <p>Tracking is standard. Insurance options depend on order size and carrier options (confirmed at checkout/review).</p>

      <h2>Returns?</h2>
      <p>Because these are bullion-style products and market prices move, returns are limited. See Terms for the v0 draft policy.</p>

      <h2>What if I think there’s a problem with my order?</h2>
      <p>Contact us immediately. We’ll respond fast and keep it clean.</p>

      <h2>Do you ship to P.O. Boxes?</h2>
      <p>Policy varies by carrier and order value. We can confirm during order review.</p>

      <h2>Are these cleaned coins?</h2>
      <p>We do not market “cleaned” coins as a feature. Raw coins vary; if you need specific standards, request a quote.</p>
