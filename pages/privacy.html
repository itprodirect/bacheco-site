      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="small">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>
        Bache &amp; Co. (“we”, “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect,
        how we use it, and the choices you have. This is a v0 policy and will be refined as the site evolves.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p><b>Information you provide.</b> When you submit a reservation/order request or contact us, you may provide:</p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>Name, email, phone (if provided)</li>
        <li>Shipping address</li>
        <li>Order details (product, quantity) and any notes</li>
        <li>Communications you send us (messages, emails)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Automatically collected information.</b> Like most websites, our hosting/log systems may collect:</p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>IP address, browser type, device type, and basic request logs</li>
        <li>Pages viewed and approximate timestamps</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        We use this primarily for security, abuse prevention, and basic site performance troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>To respond to inquiries and process reservation/order requests</li>
        <li>To verify details for fraud prevention and dispute reduction</li>
        <li>To provide shipping/tracking updates once an order is confirmed</li>
        <li>To maintain security and monitor for abuse (e.g., bot traffic)</li>
        <li>To comply with legal requirements when applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        v0 ordering is reservation-style. Payment instructions (e.g., wire/ACH) are confirmed during order review.
        We do <b>not</b> intentionally collect or store full bank/card credentials on this site.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>How we share information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information only as needed to operate:</p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li><b>Shipping carriers</b> (name/address/contact needed to deliver packages and provide tracking)</li>
        <li><b>Service providers</b> that help us run the site or communications (hosting, email, security)</li>
        <li><b>Legal/compliance</b> if required by law, court order, or to prevent fraud/abuse</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Cookies &amp; analytics</h2>
      <p>
        v0 does not use heavy analytics by default. Basic technical logs may exist through our hosting and security tooling.
        If we add analytics later, we’ll update this policy and aim to keep tracking minimal.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only as long as necessary to fulfill requests, run operations, resolve disputes,
        and meet legal requirements. We may retain limited records for accounting and fraud prevention.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards appropriate for a small e-commerce operation (access controls, minimal data collection,
        and secure infrastructure patterns). No method is 100% secure, but we design to minimize risk.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>You can request access, correction, or deletion of your information (subject to legal/operational limits).</li>
        <li>You can opt out of non-essential communications by telling us.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions or requests? Contact us via the <a href="/pages/contact.html"><u>Contact page</u></a>.
        (v0 contact details will be finalized in the next iteration.)
      </p>

      <div class="notice small">
        <b>Note:</b> This policy is a v0 draft for a new operation. We’ll tighten it as payments, fulfillment,
        and compliance processes are finalized.
