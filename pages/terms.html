      <h1>Terms of Sale &amp; Use</h1>
      <p class="small">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>
        These Terms govern your use of this site and purchases/reservations with Bache &amp; Co. (“Bache”, “we”, “us”).
        By placing a reservation/order request, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>1) Products &amp; condition (Raw BU)</h2>
      <p>
        v0 products are offered as <b>raw BU (Brilliant Uncirculated appearance)</b> coins. “BU” is a market description,
        not a third-party certified grade. Raw coins commonly show bag marks/contact marks and natural toning variation.
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li><b>No numeric grade guarantee</b> unless explicitly stated in writing.</li>
        <li><b>Photos are representative</b> unless a specific photographed coin is listed.</li>
        <li><b>“Our Choice”</b> means dates/mints vary; we select from our BU inventory.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>2) Pricing &amp; market movement</h2>
      <p>
        Pricing is based on a formula tied to the live silver market and operational premium:
        <b>Spot × 0.77344 oz + premium</b>, with premiums varying by product and quantity.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Metals pricing moves quickly. Displayed spot information on this site may be delayed or shown as a stub in v0.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>3) Reservation-style ordering (v0)</h2>
      <p>
        Submitting the order form creates a <b>reservation request</b>, not a final sale. We confirm availability, totals,
        and payment instructions before accepting the order.
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>We may decline or limit quantities for fraud prevention, inventory constraints, or compliance reasons.</li>
        <li>We may require identity verification for larger orders or suspicious activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>4) Payment (Wire/ACH only)</h2>
      <p>
        v0 accepts <b>wire/ACH only</b>. We do not accept credit cards in v0. Payment instructions are provided during
        order confirmation.
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>Orders are not shipped until payment <b>clears</b>.</li>
        <li>Buyer is responsible for any bank fees.</li>
        <li>Payment must be received within the confirmation window stated (commonly 12–24 hours for market-tied pricing).</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>5) Order confirmation, cancellations &amp; non-payment</h2>
      <p>
        If payment is not received within the confirmed window, the reservation may be canceled and inventory released.
        If a cancellation occurs, a new reservation may be required at current market pricing.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>6) Shipping, delivery &amp; risk of loss</h2>
      <p>
        Shipping options, insurance, and signature requirements are confirmed during order review. We typically ship with
        tracking and may require signature for higher-value orders.
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>Risk of loss transfers upon carrier acceptance unless otherwise required by law.</li>
        <li>Ensure your shipping address is correct. Address errors can cause delays, reroutes, or return fees.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>7) Returns &amp; disputes (market-linked items)</h2>
      <p>
        Because bullion/metal-linked items fluctuate with market pricing, <b>returns are limited</b>.
        If an issue occurs, contact us immediately so we can attempt to resolve it quickly.
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>We may require photos and/or return of the item before resolution.</li>
        <li>Any approved return must be in original condition and packaging (as shipped).</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to refuse returns that show signs of alteration, cleaning, or mishandling after delivery.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>8) Authenticity</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to sell authentic coins and maintain careful sourcing. If you have a concern about authenticity, contact us
        immediately. We will work with you in good faith to review and resolve legitimate issues.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>9) Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Taxes, if applicable, may depend on shipping destination and local rules. v0 is a simplified launch; we will refine
        tax handling as the operation scales.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>10) Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to abuse the site, attempt unauthorized access, scrape inventory at scale, or use the site in a way
        that disrupts operations.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>11) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p class="small">
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bache &amp; Co. will not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
        damages. Our total liability for any claim related to an order will not exceed the amount paid for that order.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>12) Updates to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms as the business evolves. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
      </p>

      <div class="notice small">
